//! Direct Memory Access.
//!
//! [Transfer::init](struct.Transfer.html#method.init) is only implemented for
//! valid combinations of peripheral-stream-channel-direction, providing compile
//! time checking.
//!
//! This module implements Memory To Memory, Peripheral To Memory and Memory to
//! Peripheral transfers, double buffering is supported only for Peripheral To
//! Memory and Memory to Peripheral transfers.
//!
//! Given that the Cortex-M7 core is capable of reordering accesses between
//! normal and device memory, we insert DMB instructions to ensure correct
//! operation. See ARM DAI 0321A, Section 3.2 which discusses the use of DMB
//! instructions in DMA controller configuration.
